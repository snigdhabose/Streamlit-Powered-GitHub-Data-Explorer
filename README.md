# GitHub Repo Insights Dashboard using Streamlit

An interactive dashboard built using **Streamlit** to analyze and visualize data from GitHub repositories. This project fetches repository metrics like contributors, commit history, issue tracking, and more to provide valuable insights for project maintainers and developers.

## Features

- **Repo Metrics Overview:** Display stats like stars, forks, open issues, and more.
- **Commit Analysis:** Visualize commit frequency and patterns over time.
- **Contributor Stats:** Identify key contributors and their activity levels.
- **Issue Insights:** Track open/closed issues and pull requests.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Charts and graphs for easy analysis of repo data.
- **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Fetch up-to-date data directly from the GitHub API.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Backend/Data:** GitHub API, Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `requests` for fetching data from the GitHub API
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `streamlit` for creating the interactive dashboard

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-insights-dashboard.git
    cd repo-insights-dashboard
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. Open the app in your browser:

    Streamlit will provide a local URL like `http://localhost:8501`. Open this in your browser to start exploring.

## How It Works

1. Enter a GitHub repository name (in the format `owner/repo`) into the Streamlit app.
2. The app fetches data from the GitHub API for the specified repository.
3. Visualizations and statistics are displayed based on the repository’s commits, contributors, issues, and general metadata.
